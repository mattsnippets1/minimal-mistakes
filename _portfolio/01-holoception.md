Currently I am working on Holoception, a 3rd person VR combat game as a team member of [Holonautic](https://www.holonautic.com). It is a comical arena fighting game where you control a little stick figure trying to stay alive in a hostile environment. Loads of weapons, fierce foes, bullet time and spilling ink. Coming soon in early access!
