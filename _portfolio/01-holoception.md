Currently I am working on Holoception, a physics-based VR combat game with hybrid 1st/3rd person perspective as a team member of [Holonautic](https://www.holonautic.com). It is a comical arena fighting game where you control a little stick figure trying to stay alive in a hostile environment. Loads of weapons, fierce foes, bullet time and spilling ink. Available in Early Access on Steam and Oculus Store.
