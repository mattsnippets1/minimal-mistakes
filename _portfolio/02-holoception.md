During my time as a developer at [Holonautic](https://www.holonautic.com) I worked on Holoception (amongst several projects) which is a physics-based VR combat game with hybrid 1st/3rd person perspective. It is a humorous arena fighting title where you control a little stick figure trying to stay alive in a hostile environment.

The arms of the protagonist are mapped to VR controllers which provides a unique feel of proprioception. Loads of weapons, fierce foes, bullet time and spilling ink. Available in Early Access on Steam and Oculus Store.

*Engine: Unity -- Platform: VR (Oculus, HTC, Index)*
