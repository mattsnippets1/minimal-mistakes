Hi,  
This is the developer blog and portfolio of Matt (Mate Meszaros), mostly about Unity engine, game development and C# related stuff. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

The pronunciation of my name might not be obvious, here's a little help:   
[Name recording]({{ site.url }}/assets/download/name.wav) *([ˈmaːteː] [ˈmeːsaːroʃ])*
